                                <p>In building FindMe, we started with the assumption that locating the person who was
                                wandering was the only concern, and we decided by build a GPS locator that had
                                a much longer battery life than what we could find on the market. The reason
                                for placing such an emphasis on battery life, was straightforward for us: the
                                adult children of parents with Alzheimer's were not always living with that parent,
                                and oftentimes they could visit only on weekends.&nbsp; This meant that the GPS
                                locator we needed to build had to have at least seven days of battery life, compared
                                to the one or two days that were say reported in consumer reviews of existing
                                GPS locators.</p>
                                <p>The other key focus we had was on not using a wristband, or an amulet, because we
                                learned from research at Assisted Care and Memory Care facilities that amulets
                                were very quickly removed by the residents of professionally run facilities,
                                and that wristbands were either quickly removed, or chafed at endlessly.</p>
                                <p>Design was also an important consideration.&nbsp; Studies done by AARP found that
                                wearing or carrying devices that looked "medical" were resisted by everyone,
                                because such designs tended to make the wearer feels stigmatized and shunned.
                                Regardless of one's age and cognitive deficits, one always wanted to look at
                                their best and most capable.</p>
                                <p>So, within those constraints, we proceeded to select a hardware chipset that could
                                accommodate those goals, and focused on then keeping the costs down to the most
                                affordable level we could. That meant, in that early stage, opting for a 2G network,
                                a GSM modem because of its small size and low cost, and making the assumption
                                that we could use the 2G/GSM combination with the T-Mobile network until 2017—when
                                T-Mobile would begin deprecating that network (ATT already had started taking
                                down their 2G network). That T-Mobile 2G network ran in the 1700 mhz range, which
                                would become important for us as we began development.</p>
                                <p>We selected the chipset we would use, the accelerometers, and GPS chip, and the Modem
                                and Microprocessor, and began to build "spikes" to prove out concept and the
                                end to end functionality we needed.</p>
                                <blockquote class="custom-quote">
                                    <p>It wasn't enough to know the location of someone, <em>it was just as important
                                    to know whether or  not they were in trouble</em></p>
                                </blockquote>
                                <p>And, it was at about that time that we learned two new things: First, it wasn't enough
                                to know the location of someone, <em>it was just as important to know whether or not
                                they were in trouble</em> – which could be completely independent of location. Witness
                                the recent tragedy from the recent Northeast blizzard, Juno, where an 83 year old man
                                froze to death in his backyard during that storm.&nbsp; A GPS locator would have never shown
                                that he was in trouble, because it would have looked like – on a map – he was
                                safe at home (GPS locators won't reliably show when you are inside, or outside,
                                your back door.</p>
                                <p>This meant further research into what the actual causes of injury were, related to
                                wandering and Alzheimer's.&nbsp; While research was thin on the topic of what
                                actually causes the serious injuries for people who have gone wandering, we found
                                that there were three key areas of vulnerability:</p>
                                <p>(1) Injury from hypothermia and heat exhaustion/stroke,
                                <br> (2) Traffic incidents, both while driving and walking, and
                                <br> (3) Drowning.
                                </p>
                                <p>Falling was also found to be a significant risk factor, however it was independent
                                of wandering behavior.</p>
                                <p>After much time, we determined that we could address two of the four causes of injury:
                                Hypothermia/Heat Stroke, and Falling. We committed to using a temperature sensor
                                to detect significant changes in the external environment, and an accelerometer
                                to detect falling. Guarding against traffic danger and drowning risk would require
                                a great deal more research, which would have to be delayed for the product's
                                first release. </p>
                                <p>The second thing we learned was that using a high-frequency 1700mgz network was going
                                to lead to occasional failures in getting a signal out from indoor spaces. This
                                became clear to us when we researched the reviews of existing generic GPS locators
                                for children, where the users complained that the system was not showing when
                                they were in their school buildings or other indoor environments.</p>
                                <p>After much hand-wringing, and even more research, we determined that the best way
                                to solved the problem getting access to a relatively low frequency network was
                                to switch from the low-cost GSM modem to the more expensive, and large, CDMA
                                modem that would run on the Verizon network. </p>
                                <p>While this solved the problem for the United States, it did not yet address the issue
                                for the EU and Asia. Mostly, GSM was the standard on both those continents, and
                                fortunately 2G networks would still be in use for many years to come, in the
                                900 mgz range.</p>
                                <p>This left only one more issue: how to get a GPS fix when the individual was within
                                a windowless environment, where there was no way to get a satellite fix. For
                                that issue, we needed to use trilateration, where the modem that pings the cell
                                tower(s) can use information gathered from signal strength and relative position
                                to approximate the location of the FindMe device. Presently, that's our approach
                                to getting an approximate fix on the device location, enabled by the location-based
                                servers provided by Verizon and our chip manufacturers as well. However, its
                                approximation has an standard deviation that approaches 100 meters, so we'll
                                be researching way to significantly improve on that approximation in the near
                                future.</p>
                                <p>For the present, then, we've been able to address to a meaningful degree a variety
                                of hazards that befall individuals living with Alzheimer's: becoming lost or
                                wandering both indoors and outdoors, injury from extreme weather, and rescue
                                from falling. And, we've addressed the issue of long battery life, extending
                                the battery life of FindMe to an order of magnitude greater than generic locators
                                through heuristic algorithms.</p>
                                <p>Our goal is to make the persons living with Alzheimer's much safer than they had
                                been, previously, and to allow their caregivers the opportunity to breathe more
                                easily when there is a job dominated by stress and pressure.</p>
